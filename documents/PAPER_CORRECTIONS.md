# AgriPrice — Corrections for the Capstone Writeup

Generated from an audit of the **running code** against `AgriPrice_Draft_Revised.docx`.
These are places where the paper should be edited to match what the system actually does
(the code has been left as-is for these items, or already changed where noted). Each entry
cites the code that is the source of truth.

> After this audit, the code was also changed for several items (LSTM now serves live
> forecasts, 70/15/15 split, naive-persistence baseline + ADF, 3-day horizon, and
> lag/rolling/seasonality features). Those are **already true in the code** — see the
> "Now true in code" section at the bottom so your paper claims are safe to defend.

## Edit these paragraphs in the paper

### 1. Feature set — list the real inputs (Purpose & Description, Conceptual Framework, Algorithm)
The paper lists four inputs: rice price, USD-PHP exchange, weekly diesel, and an
agricultural seasonality index. The model actually trains on **more** exogenous drivers.
Per-target feature vector (`model/data_pipeline.py`, `model/meta.json`):

- target rice price, **RON-95 gasoline price**, **diesel price**, **rice-stock inventory
  (metric tons)**, **farmgate price**, **USD-PHP exchange rate**
- plus engineered features now added: seasonality (sin/cos month), 7-day rolling averages
  of diesel & exchange, and target price lags (1-day, 7-day) + 7-day rolling mean.

**Action:** update the writeup to name rice-stock inventory, farmgate price, and gasoline
alongside diesel and exchange rate. This *strengthens* the "multivariate" argument — do not
hide these inputs.

### 2. Diesel data source — not the DOE portal (Framework, Data Ingestion Module)
The paper says weekly diesel pump prices come from the **DOE portal**. The scraper actually
pulls fuel prices from **Zigwheels** (`tools/scrap.py`: `FUEL_URL = "https://www.zigwheels.ph/fuel-price"`),
a Manila pump-price aggregator, at the same 24-hour cadence as the other sources.

**Action:** either describe the fuel source accurately (a public Manila fuel-price source),
or disclose Zigwheels as a practical proxy for DOE figures. Drop the "weekly / DOE portal"
wording unless a DOE fetcher is added.

### 3. "AI-assisted PDF extraction" — it is rule-based (RRL, Framework, Implementation)
The DA-AMAS Daily Price Index PDFs are parsed by deterministic table extraction
(`tools/pdfconvrt.py` via `pdfplumber`), not an AI/ML model.

**Action:** change "AI-assisted PDF extraction" to "**rule-based / layout-aware PDF
table extraction**." This is accurate and still defensible. (Only keep "AI-assisted" if you
actually add an LLM/vision extraction step.)

### 4. Security & Data Handling — the hardcoded API key does not exist (Research Ethics)
The paper flags a hardcoded financial API key as pre-deployment debt. The exchange-rate
endpoint used (`tools/scrap.py`: `https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD`) is **keyless** —
there is no API key in the code to migrate.

**Action:** correct the subsection to state the exchange API requires no key. Describe the
admin auth accurately: server-issued session tokens, password **and** 6-digit access code
stored as **hashes** (`model/admin_auth.py`, `model/settings_store.py`), 5-attempt / 15-min
lockout. For the RA 10173 sentence: the system keeps client IP + created-time **in memory
only** for the active admin session and does **not persist/log user IP addresses**.

### 5. Dashboard is responsive, not desktop-only (Purpose, Objective 6.4, System Design)
The public site includes 109 responsive breakpoints across 13 files
(`public/**/*.css`, `public/*.html`), so it renders on mobile and desktop.

**Action:** reverse the "desktop-only" scoping to "**desktop and mobile browsers**."
Update Objective 6.4 (Compatibility) accordingly. This is a strength, not a limitation.

### 6. Scope & Limitations — weather is genuinely excluded (verify wording)
The paper's Scope says the system does not use weather/rainfall. Confirmed: the current model
does **not** use any weather/rainfall feature (an old `weather_data` table exists in the DB
but is not in the feature set). This is consistent — no change needed, just don't reintroduce
rainfall as a feature without updating the Scope.

## Now true in code (safe to keep as written / strengthen)

- **LSTM produces the live forecast.** The dashboard forecast is served by the per-type LSTM
  models via `/api/predictions` (`model/predict.py`). A previous heuristic "2026 formula" path
  was demoted to an explicit, off-by-default fallback (`AGRIPRICE_FORMULA_MODE`). You can state
  plainly that the LSTM generates the displayed forecasts.
- **Chronological 70/15/15 split, no leakage.** `model/train.py` splits sequences 70/15/15 in
  time order, fits the scaler on **train rows only**, and uses the middle 15% as a true
  validation set (early stopping) with the final 15% held out for reporting. The paper's
  MANDATORY chronological-split requirement is satisfied.
- **Naive-persistence baseline + ADF.** Every rice type now reports LSTM MAE/RMSE **and** a
  naive-persistence baseline MAE/RMSE, a `beats_baseline` flag, an ADF p-value, an
  **ARIMA(1,1,1) baseline**, and a **shock-day comparison** (`model/meta.json`, all visible in
  Admin → Metrics). Cite these numbers in the Statistical Treatment / Testing chapters.

  ⚠️ **IMPORTANT — how to frame the result honestly (defense-critical).**
  On the held-out test set (clean chronological split), for **Local Well-Milled**:

  | Model | MAE (₱/kg, all test days) |
  |---|---|
  | Multivariate LSTM (anchored-delta) | 0.247 |
  | Naive persistence | 0.229 |
  | ARIMA(1,1,1) | 0.229 |

  All 8 types look the same: **LSTM ≈ persistence ≈ ARIMA** (LSTM within ₱0.003–0.03).
  ARIMA(1,1,1) collapses to persistence here because the series is a near random walk
  (ADF p ≈ 0.07 → cannot reject a unit root). A **shock-day analysis** (top-10% most volatile
  test days, where price moved ≥ ₱1.0 from the last value) was run specifically to look for LSTM
  advantage where it should matter most: the LSTM beat persistence on only **2/8** types and by
  a trivial margin (₱0.001–0.003). So the LSTM does **not** reliably win even during volatility.

  **Defensible framing (do this):**
  1. Report LSTM, persistence, AND ARIMA side by side — all three tie. (Numbers are in Admin →
     Metrics and `model/meta.json`.)
  2. State the honest conclusion: at a 1–3 day horizon, NCR rice retail prices are effectively a
     random walk, so no model — classical or deep — meaningfully beats "tomorrow ≈ today." This
     is itself a **valid empirical finding** and matches the efficient-short-horizon literature.
  3. The LSTM's contribution is a **unified multivariate system**: one pipeline forecasting all
     8 rice types while incorporating fuel, FX, stock, farmgate, and seasonality — matching
     classical baselines' accuracy, not a claim of beating them.
  4. Frame accuracy superiority as **future work** (longer horizons where drivers matter; explicit
     shock/anomaly features; GARCH for volatility).
  5. Note the earlier ₱0.47 figure was inflated by test-into-validation leakage.
  **Do NOT** claim the LSTM outperforms the baselines — the data does not support it and a
  technical panel will check.
- **48–72 hour (3-day) horizon.** `HORIZON = 3` (`model/data_pipeline.py`); the API and both
  dashboards now show Day 1/2/3. Matches the "48–72 hour / 2–3 day" claim.
- **Feature engineering (lag + rolling + seasonality).** Implemented in
  `data_pipeline.add_engineered_features()` and used by both training and inference. The
  Conceptual Framework's "lag variables and rolling averages" claim is now real.

## Still needs YOUR team's input (unchanged by this audit)
- Per-stratum UAT headcounts (household / vendor / IT / DA-AMAS) — paper blanks.
- Sprint count/duration and backlog screenshots.
- Synthesis Matrix rows + at least one counter-evidence study (DL not beating a baseline) — your
  own results are now a concrete example of this.
- "Rockets and feathers": current lag features are symmetric. If you want to *model* the
  asymmetry (not just cite it), add separate rising/falling diesel & FX lag features; otherwise
  note it as a limitation.
